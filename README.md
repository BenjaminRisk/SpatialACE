# SpatialACE
Estimate the spatial additive genetic, common environmental, and unique environmental model for cortical surface data. These files support the manuscript: Risk, Benjamin B., and Hongtu Zhu. "ACE of space: estimating genetic components of high-dimensional imaging data." Biostatistics. https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxz022

Tutorial.m provides an example in which the spatial Additive genetic, Common environmental, and unique Environmental model with measurement error is fit to data simulated on a sphere. These programs were written by Benjamin Risk with contributions from Shikai Luo in Dr. Hongtu Zhu's BIG-S2 lab group.
