# SpatialACE
Estimate the spatial additive genetic, common environmental, and unique environmental model for cortical surface data. These files support the working manuscript "ACE of Space: Estimating Genetic Components of High-Dimensional Imaging Data."

Tutorial.m provides an example in which the spatial Additive genetic, Common environmental, and unique Environmental model with measurement error is fit to data simulated on a sphere. These programs were written by Benjamin Risk with contributions from Shikai Luo in Dr. Hongtu Zhu's BIG-S2 lab group.
