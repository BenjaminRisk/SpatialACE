The functions are labeled in the order in which they should be run:
1. a1_Simulations_screeplots_local.m
2. a2_Simulations_simulateSpatialACEM_cluster.m
3. a3_Simulations_surfaceplots_tables_local.m
4. a4_Simulations_boxplots_local.R

Note that programs labeled "local" (i.e., a1, a3, and a4) can be run on a local machine. The file a2_Simulations_simulateSpatialACEM_cluster.m should be run on a cluster; it took 5 hours with 48 logical processors.
